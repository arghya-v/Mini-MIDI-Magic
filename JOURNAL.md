Note: I kinda forgot I had to journal, but luckily I have screenshots of questions I asked during Slack, so I will use those from the 24th - 29th of September

# September 24th (8PM-10PM)

I started by looking at the mini MIDI magic guide. Alognside that I also installed KiCad and started to learn how it works. I also learned about the switch matrix system, and decided to implement that in my project. 
Initially, I was confused about the switch matrix and what it meant, but I figured it out and got started by making 4 rows like this

<br></br>

# September 26th (7PM - 9PM)

After I made my rows, I started to work and learn about rotary encoders, initially, I had made a 6x6 matrix, but I realized that I only need a 4x5 matrix, and I leave the other 2 rows for my rotary encoders.
It took me a while to figure it out, because I was new to making schematics, but I luckily got some help on the slack, and then made a schematic like so:

<br></br>

# September 27th (10AM - 12 Noon)

I then proceeded to add on the SD card and LCD screen, I decided to stick with the guide here, because I am new. The LCD was pretty easy to add, but I had to ask some questions regarding the SD card because there wasn't a full screenshot for it. In the end I got it working though.

# September 29th (8AM - 9AM)
To finish off, I got my work checked over, fixed an issue with the switches, and then did some organizing. 
This was my final BASE schematic.

I am hoping to add a slide, potentiometer later on and customize it to my liking.
