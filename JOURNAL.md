## 10/3/2025 - Migrating my project!  

I am working on mini midi magic, so now I am migrating my project to blueprint!

So far, I have worked on my schematic, and I am hoping to source my parts from Adafruit  

## 10/6/2025 2:05 PM - Starting (September 24th)  

I started by looking at the mini MIDI magic guide. Alognside that I also installed KiCad and started to learn how it works. I also learned about the switch matrix system, and decided to implement that in my project. Initially, I was confused about the switch matrix and what it meant, but I figured it out and got started by making 4 rows like this

## 10/6/2025 2:06 PM - Rotary Encoders (September 26th)  

After I made my rows, I started to work and learn about rotary encoders, initially, I had made a 6x6 matrix, but I realized that I only need a 4x5 matrix, and I leave the other 2 rows for my rotary encoders. It took me a while to figure it out, because I was new to making schematics, but I luckily got some help on the slack, and then made a schematic like so:
