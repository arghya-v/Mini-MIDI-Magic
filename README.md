# My Custom MIDI Controller 🎛️

**Author:** Arghya Vyas  
**Created On:** September 29, 2025  
**Description:** A simple custom MIDI controller I designed and built from scratch using KiCad and 3D modeling tools.

## 🧠 Overview
This project documents the creation of my custom MIDI controller, from schematic design in KiCad to PCB routing and 3D chassis modeling in TinkerCad.  
I learned about switch matrices, rotary encoders, I2S DAC modules, and custom footprints.

## Features

- Compact 4×5 switch matrix for customizable key input

- Rotary encoders for parameter control (e.g. volume, modulation)

- Slide potentiometer for expressive MIDI control

- LCD screen for real-time feedback and menus

- ADS1015 ADC expansion for additional analog inputs

- I2S DAC output for high-quality audio signals

- Custom PCB design built in KiCad

- 3D-printed chassis with modular top and bottom plates

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **KiCad 9.0** – schematic & PCB design  
- **TinkerCad** – chassis modeling  
- **Hackclub Slack** – troubleshooting and collaboration  
- **Adafruit** – components & footprint references  
- **Orpheus Pico** – main controller  


## 💡 Reflection
This project was a great learning experience — I learned how to:
- Use KiCad effectively for multi-part designs  
- Understand switch matrices and ADC expansion  
- Create and import custom footprints  
- Transition from schematic to PCB  
- Design a printable chassis in CAD  

Overall, this was my first big hardware project, and I’m really proud of how it turned out!
